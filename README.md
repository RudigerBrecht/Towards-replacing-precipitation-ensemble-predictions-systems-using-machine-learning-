# Towards replacing precipitation ensemble predictions systems using machine learning 

Precipitation forecasts are less accurate compared to other meteorological fields because several key processes affecting precipitation distribution and intensity occur below the resolved scale of global weather prediction models. This requires to use higher resolution simulations. To generate an uncertainty prediction associated with the forecast, ensembles of simulations are run simultaneously. However, the computational cost is a limiting factor here. Thus, instead of generating an ensemble system from simulations there is a trend of using neural networks. Unfortunately the data for high resolution ensemble runs is not available. We propose a new approach to generating ensemble weather predictions for high-resolution precipitation without requiring high-resolution training data. The method uses generative adversarial networks to learn the complex patterns of precipitation and produce diverse and realistic precipitation fields, allowing to generate realistic precipitation ensemble members using only the available control forecast. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating realistic precipitation ensemble members on unseen higher resolutions.
We use evaluation metrics such as RMSE, CRPS, rank histogram and ROC curves to demonstrate that our generated ensemble is almost identical to the ECMWF IFS ensemble.
